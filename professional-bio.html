header_text: It is a promotional summary in an essay format of your most important highlights used for consulting, presenting or job searching. It is a summary of who are you as an employer, business person, or professional. A professional biography is the art of presenting yourself in the best possible and most interesting light, without actually engaging in anything that smacks of a hard sell.

            <h4>When to use a Professional Biography</h4>
            <p>A professional biography may be used for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A description of you on your website</li>
                <li>A description of you in a brochure</li>
                <li>A description of you on a book jacket, should you write a book</li>
                <li>A description of you as an employee in a company Facebook or other company literature</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <h4> Tips for Writing a Professional Biography</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Brevity is everything. Try to keep your history to a page or less, much the same way you should with a resume. You have only seconds to capture a reader or listener’s attention, and you should write your biography with that in mind.</li>
                <li>Don’t let the necessity for weighing words carefully stop you from being spontaneous. The thing about writing, especially on a computer, is that it only takes a few strokes to erase and edit what you’ve done.</li>
                <li>Don’t self-edit to the point where you can’t put a word on paper. You’re not an expert, so you need to put down more than you will eventually wind up with. That’s what editing is for. Don’t edit yourself before you’ve written a word.</li>
                <li>Remember: shorter is better, breezy is fine, but too informal won’t sell.</li>
                <li>Be serious, but be friendly. Make your history accessible to the people learning about you.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is important not to bore your audience. Write the kind of biography you’d like to read if it were written about someone else. Using your own good taste and judgment will do a lot to win potential business colleagues to your side.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <p>Depending on the media you are using, when writing a biography, you should usually talk about yourself as if you are writing about someone else. On the other hand, Bio for LinkedIn for example, it is sometimes  written in first person.<br>Remember the person reading or listening to your biography doesn’t want to feel like he stole your diary. Use your imagination and turn yourself into a person you are observing. Use that special insight gained by sitting back and watching to write your professional biography.</p>

            <h4>5 important elements of a strong bio that you should keep in mind when starting to write the bio:y</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Keep in mind the intended market of the bio. Who will be reading this document — potential employers? Partners in a new business venture? The directors of a board? Whoever the audience, the bio should engage and share . What information would these people want to know that they wouldn’t get from a resume? Maybe it’s their mission or purpose that drives them in their work, or it’s a specific example of how they became the go-to person in their role as head director or leader.</li>
                <li>What is the personal perspective of the subject? This is something you cannot get from a resume, and very important to include in a bio. This can highlight the vision of the subject, and provide greater meaning on their career trajectory and how they arrived at where they are today.</li>
                <li>Highlight key awards or achievements. While you may not be able to list every single award earned, you can highlight the achievements that connect to key points in the person’s career, or that contribute to the image you are trying to portray.</li>
                <li>Remember that you are telling a story. A well-written story engages the reader from beginning to end. So, keep the tone conversational.</li>
                <li>Throwing in some personal information at the end of the bio also creates a nice picture. Brief information about hobbies or family is always a nice touch, and again engages the reader. Adding this is in works great for a one-page bio, but not needed for a shorter, executive bio.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Remember, the goal of a professional bio is to enlighten the reader with information they wouldn’t be able to gather from a resume. It should show a little bit of your personality, while at the same time sharing what makes you interesting and an asset for a project or position (or whatever goal you have in mind).</p>

                    <h3>What is the difference between a Resume, CV and Bio?</h3>
                    <p>By Dr. Tom Denham on July 16, 2010 <br><br>
                        When it comes to packaging and marketing your background, you have three main choices: 1) a resume, 2) a CV (curriculum vitae) or 3) a bio (career biography).  There are some significant differences.  You will need to determine the reader’s preference – do they want something short, something more detailed or a promotional document.<br>
                        <strong>Resume</strong> – a one or two page bulleted list of your professional information used to apply for a job.
                        It can either be in a chronological, functional, combination or business card format.  A resume contains the factual and specific details of your education, experience, job titles, certifications and skills.  The resume is the first impression an employer has of you and it is used to screen candidates for interviews.  It is not your life history.  It’s a wise idea to make sure the resume is tailored to the position you are applying for.  When you apply for the majority of jobs in the private, public and non-profit sectors, a one page resume works best.  A two page resume is acceptable for some fields and also for jobs that require more extensive experience.<br> 
                        <strong>CV</strong> – a resume that is two or more pages and typically used for an academic, research or fellowship search.
                        It gives a complete and lengthy account of your professional background.  It is Latin for “course of one’s life.”  Like the resume, the goal of the CV is to get an interview.  Styles and opinions vary so make sure you are tailoring your CV to the institution’s needs.  For example, are they looking for someone who has extensive research experience or perhaps a person who has a strong teaching and administrative background?  Due to the extended length of the CV, it is going to have more categories than a resume.  I have seen some CVs that consist of 15 or more pages.  Some of the categories may include the following:
                        Education, Certifications, Dissertation/Thesis Topic, Teaching Experience, Administrative Experience, Research Experience, Computer Skills, Laboratory Experience, Languages, Presentations/Publication Experience, University Involvement, Consulting Experience, Affiliations/Professional Associations/Memberships, Scholarships/Fellowships, Honors/Awards, Research Interest<br>
                        <strong>Bio</strong> – a promotional summary in an essay format of your most important highlights used for consulting, presenting or job searching.
                        It is an overview of you without specific dates or detailed duties.  Written in the third person, it is a compelling story of your most compelling achievements.  Keep it more informal and interesting.  Stick to no more than one page with a few paragraphs.  Bios can include photos, credentials, awards, personal information, name dropping of companies and impressive job titles.  It is a piece of advertising especially for consulting and presentations.<br>
                        <strong>Career Tools</strong>
                        All three are tools for your career development.  I encourage all of my clients to have a lifetime “Master Resume” or CV that they can develop into a current one or two page resume or bio.  Whether you use a resume, CV or bio, get it professionally critiqued and update it annually.  Which ever format you use, be truthful and be sure you can back up your claims in the interview.  By first considering your field and background, you can select the best way to market your candidacy in order to achieve your objectives.<br>
         
                        <strong>Tom’s Tip:</strong> Build your background, then package it properly.<br>

                    <p>This site was created to provide you with all the course materials  and tools you will need to understand each topic clearly .  You can consult it as many times as you require. Furthermore, if you feel that some items are needed, please feel free to let me know so they can be included. All new ideas are welcome.
    The site is divided into modules. Under each module you will find the topics included in it.  A section with extra resources is included as well. There you can find several items that will help you with your writing and speaking. Only Module 1 is ready, the rest is still under construction. I will get them ready asap. Despite of the former,  I would recommend to consult the site regularly since new content will be included from time to time.
    Remember this site is only a repository for course information and tools to use; the appropriate way to communicate will be Blackboard or e-mail: atorresro@itesm.mx
 Any further questions, please let me know I'll be glad to help you.</p>
